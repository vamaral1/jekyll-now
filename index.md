Hello! I'm a data scientist and engineer with a passion for building impactful products. I obtained my BS in Computer Engineering from The Johns Hopkins University in 2015 and became fascinated by machine learning after taking an introductory course junior year. I immediately wanted to take every other relevant course so I applied and enrolled in the Master's program in CS and graduated in 2016. Since then,  I've worked at a large consulting company and two startups solving data problems in computer vision and NLP, among others. I was born in Brazil and have lived in 6 US states spanning from California to New York. Throughout this journey Iâ€™ve learned to embrace change, be persistent, and keep an open mind to others. I've also picked up several hobbies along the way including soccer, surfing, snowboarding, motorcycles, and a couple musical instruments. Feel free to connect on any of the sites below!
