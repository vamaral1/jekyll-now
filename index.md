Hello! I'm a JHU alumnus, a data scientist, and a thrill-seeker. I obtained a joint BS/MS in Computer Engineering/Computer Science from The Johns Hopkins University in 2016 and became fascinated by machine learning after taking an introductory course junior year. I immediately wanted to take every other relevant course the school offered so I applied for the combined graduate program. In terms of the data world, I'm primarily interested in machine learning for modeling dynamical systems and its applications to health, robotics, and IoT. I was born in Brazil and have lived in 5 US states spanning from California to New York. I've picked up several hobbies along the way including: soccer, surfing, mountain biking, snowboarding, and playing guitar/bass/drums. Feel free to connect on any of the sites below!
