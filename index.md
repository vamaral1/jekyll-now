Hello! I'm a data scientist and engineer with a passion for building impactful products. During my undergrad, I became fascinated with machine learning and wanted to dive deeper and continue learning. I obtained my BS in computer engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2015 and a MS in computer science a year later. Since then, I've worked at a large consulting company and two startups solving data problems in computer vision and NLP, among others. During my career, I've enjoyed working on new, vaguely-defined problems with other friendly and fearless peers. I was born in Brazil and have lived in 6 US states spanning from California to New York. Throughout this journey Iâ€™ve learned to embrace change, be persistent, and keep an open mind to others. I've also picked up several hobbies along the way including soccer, surfing, snowboarding, motorcycling, and a couple musical instruments. Feel free to connect on any of the sites below!
