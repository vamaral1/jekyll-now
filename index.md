Hello! I'm a data scientist who also loves adventures and music. I obtained my BS in Computer Engineering from The Johns Hopkins University in 2015 but became fascinated by machine learning after taking an introductory course junior year. I immediately wanted to take every other relevant course the school offered so I applied and enrolled in the Master's program in CS and graduated in 2016. Since then,  I've worked as a data scientist at a large consulting company and a start-up. In terms of the data world, I'm primarily interested in machine learning for modeling dynamical systems and its applications to health, robotics, and IoT. I was born in Brazil and have lived in 6 US states spanning from California to New York. Throughout this journey Iâ€™ve learned to embrace change, be persistent, and keep an open mind to others. I've also picked up several hobbies along the way including soccer, surfing, mountain biking, snowboarding, and a couple musical instruments. Feel free to connect on any of the sites below!
